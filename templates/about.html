    The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in
    recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the king of the Lonely Mountain when
    Smaug came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire,
    Gandalf decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force.
    Gandalf also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash
    action. The superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to
    leave on other business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.

        <h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>
        <p>
            In the year TA 2746, Thorin II was born to Dwarven prince Thráin II in the mountain city of The Lonely
            Mountain.
            Early in his youth, he and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug
            in TA
            2770. While in exile, he quickly grew to become a capable warrior. This was demonstrated when he
            participated in the
            Battle of Azanulbizar in TA 2799. He marched with one of the Dwarven armies beneath the East-gate of Moria.
            At some
            point in the fighting, his shield broke, and using an oaken tree branch found on the floor as a shield, he
            gained
            the epithet "Oakenshield," which would remain with him even in death.

        <h3>Fili and Kili</h3>
        <p>
            Fíli and Kíli were nephews of Thorin, who was the elder brother of their mother, Dís. They were also nephews
            of Frerin, grandsons of Thráin II, and great-grandsons of Thrór. Fíli's most distinguishing feature was his
            long nose, the longest of any of the Dwarves in Thorin's company.

            As the youngest Dwarves, Fíli and Kíli had the sharpest eyes, and were often sent scouting or searching. It
            was they that found the Front Porch while in the Misty Mountains.

            With the other Dwarves, Fíli and Kíli encountered spiders and were later imprisoned by the Elvenking
            Thranduil. They escaped the cells thanks to Bilbo, traveling down the river in barrels until they reached
            Lake-town. The brothers accompanied Thorin and Bilbo to Lake-town while the others rested by the
            river.

            At the feet of the Lonely Mountain, Fíli and Kíli scouted Ravenhill and found the Front Gate with Balin and
            Bilbo. Also, with Bilbo, they found the side-door leading into the mountain.

            Both brothers were killed while defending the mortally wounded Thorin Oakenshield in the Battle of Five
            Armies, and all three were buried with honor.

        <h3>Óin</h3>
        <p>
            In T.A. 2989[7] Óin had followed Balin with a colony of Dwarves in an attempt to reclaim their ancient
            mansions
            of Khazad-dûm, which were occupied by Orcs. At first the colony did well, but on November 10, 2994 Balin was
            killed,
            and the Orcs returned. They took the East-gate/First Hall then the Second Hall after a fierce battle which
            Óin likely
            fought in. Óin went with a party to find escape via the West-gate but they found the water up to the doors
            and he was
            killed by the Watcher in the Water. Of his party only four returned five days after they had left, and soon
            thereafter
            all the remaining colonists were killed in a final stand in the Chamber of Mazarbul. Their fate was unknown
            to their kinsmen and their silence was largely why Glóin and Gimli went to Rivendell at that time, to seek
            news from Elrond. When Frodo Baggins came to Rivendell, Glóin delighted in telling him about the doings of
            the renewed dwarf-kingdom. But when Frodo asked about Óin, Balin, and Ori, Glóin's face darkened and he said
            that he did not know.

        <h3>Gloin</h3>
        <p>
            The younger of the two sons of Gróin, a distant descendant of the royal line of Durin's Folk, the Longbeard
            Dwarves. Glóin's great-grandfather Borin had been the younger son of King Náin II, and thus through many
            generations Glóin son of Gróin could claim descent from King Glóin of the Grey Mountains. King Glóin was
            succeeded by his son Óin, strongly suggesting that Gróin's sons were named Óin and Glóin after these ancient
            ancestors.

            Glóin was born into fraught times for his people. He was just seven years old when King Thrór was murdered
            in Moria, sparking the War of the Dwarves and the Orcs that lasted for the next nine years. After this War,
            The Dwarves of Durin's Folk wandered away out of Dunland, the land where Glóin would have spent his earliest
            years. Led northward by their leader, Thrór's son Thráin II, this band of Dwarves eventually settled among
            the Blue Mountains.
